#    v--- Notes for Jamie ---v
#Set computer screen timeout setting off
#keep both the computer and switch plugged in
#transfer own shiny (preferably hacked) through Home to test timing
#test both shiny and non-shiny with one instance in place of 10,000 in code
#reset saves with {up+b+x} between testing scenarios
#once both tests are passed, run the program at full 10,000 loops

#Welcome to the Automated Legendary Shiny Hunt script, created by shadowcage72

#To use this script, you will need python3, NXBT, and a USB Bluetooth adapter. This allows the computer to control the Nintendo witch.
#You will also need a Master Ball in order to reliably catch the pokemon.

#To use this code, follow the following steps:

#1. Make sure text speed is set to "fast", Send to Boxes is set to "Automatic", "Give Nicknames" is set to "Don't give", and Autosave is set to "Off"
#3. Go into your bag, set the Master Ball as your only favorite item, then sort the bag by favorites.
#2. Ensure that all pokemon in your party will not level up after catching the pokemon. This creates additional text boxes that makes the code fail.
#3. Ensure that the first move of your first pokemon is set to a move that will not kill the opposing pokemon, and that your first Pokemon does not have an ability triggering a text box before the fight
#4. Ensure that you have at least 2 pokemon in your party, and that there is an empty spot in your party for the pokemon to go to.
#5. Enter the sanctuary where the legendary pokemon resides. This will create a backup save to go back to in case the code fails. Place the stale in the slot.
#6. Save right in front of the legendary pokemon so that pressing "A" will start the encounter.



#From here, edit the following variables to your needs

webpage="Google Chrome" #Name of the web browswer you are using.

waittime=18 #Time in seconds for the code to wait before entering the battle menu. This is dependant of the pokemon youre catching and their ability. For Rayquaza, 18.4 is a good number. For other Pokemon without an ability causing a textbox, the ideal number is about 15.
              #I suggest testing this number yourself multiple times yourself to find a number you are comfortable with.



#I suggest testing that this code works both ways: that is to say to test that it will not catch the pokemon if it is not shiny, and that it will catch it if it is.
#To test that it will catch a shiny legendary, put a shiny pokemon as your first pokemon. This will display the same animation that would have played if the encountered pokemon were shiny. Close the program before the game saves (Or if you're feeling daring, allow it to save to ensure the entire process works, and revert back to your backup save. I do not reccomend this.)
#Remember that it is possible that an animation before the battle showing your avatar's face could show when beginning the battle. Make sure the timing works for if this animation shows and the pokemon isn't shiny, and for if this animation doesn't show and the pokemon is shiny.

#If the game saves after catching a nonshiny Pokemon:
#Don't worry! There exists a backup save. At the title screen, input up+X+B. This will prompt you to reset your save to when you entered the initial room, before encountering the legendary.
#DO NOT LEAVE THE ROOM. This may delete your backup save, leaving you stuck with a nonshiny pokemon.

#Feel free to and share this script and improve it!! If you would like to add more tips or clarify the tips I have given, please do! The code itself is simple and could be improved and optimised so feel free to do so if you wish. Personally, I chose to focus on reliability rather than optimization.
